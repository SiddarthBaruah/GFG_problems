/*
    Array with three type of value. Quick Sort Partision
    Array of size n and small ranged value(Counting sort. O(n)  S-> O(k))
    if range of size n^2 or n^3. (Radix sort)
    Data is uniformly distributed. (Bucket sort)
    When memory writes are costly. (Selection sort(O(n2)), Cycle sort(On2) optimal)
    if adjacent swaps are allowed(Bubble sort, Cocktail sort)
    when array is small(Selection sort< insertion sort)
    when available of memory is small(Shell sort(n(logn)^2))

General Purpose Sorting ALgo
==================================
    Mergesort(Stable sort algp)
    HeapSort()
    QuickSort(worst case (n^2) but works better than MS and HS)
Hybrid Sort
======================
    TimSort
    IntraSort
