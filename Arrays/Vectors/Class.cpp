/*
Advantages of vectors:
Dyanamic Size
Rich library functions, Find, Erase, insert etc
Easy to know size
No need to pass size
Can be reduced from a function
By default initialozed with intial value
We ca copy a vector to other. (v1=v2)

Like for example:

int( vector<int> v)
{
    
}// this can be directly passed into it unlike the arrays with the fixed sizes
