/*
so this is about the array

    say we have a data,
        a= {10,20,30,40}
    the first one will be allocated at a random point on the RAM

|   10|   20|   30|   40|   50|
    x   x+y     x+2y x+3y x+4y
    where   x--> Address value of first element
            y--> Data type size

Contigous memory allocations:


advntages of using array type structures
1: Random Access
2: Cache Friendlyness
