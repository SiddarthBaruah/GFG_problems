/*
Two types of array:
    1/ Fixed
    2/ Dynamic

Fixed size in c++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
int a[100]   ------------> Stack allocated
int a[n]
int *arr= new int[n] ------------>Heap allocated
int arr[]={30,20,10,40}

Dynamic Sized Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resign Automatically

for example: 
    we created an array of 100 element
    and we want to put the 101th element
    then the size of the array is doubled

it is recommended to use the dyanamic array in c++ because they behave 
like fixed sized arrays
